# AirspaceManagement
A dynamic, interactive dashboard for visualizing and managing airport operations, inspired by Boeing's TAAM system.
I wanted to build something more than just a simple to-do list. As a fan of aviation and complex systems, I was inspired by Boeing's Total Airport & Airspace Management (TAAM) system. This project is my take on itâ€”a simplified, front-end-focused dashboard that brings the core concepts of air traffic and airport management to life.

It's built entirely on the front-end, using localStorage to simulate a persistent database.

Tech Stack used for this project, are mentioned below:
Frontend: React, Vite
Routing: React Router
Mapping: React Leaflet & Leaflet.js
Styling: Plain CSS (Component-based stylesheets)
Icons: Lucide React

// Front end part is done with basic simulation, operations and alerts.
// Currently working on integrating with backend APIs and using realtime databases and integrating it with coordinates and simulate the aircrafts using latitude and longitudes.
